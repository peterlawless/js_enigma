This repository is home to a JavaScript implementation of the infamous Enigma Code Machine that saw use by all branches of the Wehrmacht during World War 2.

TODO: code samples

Special thanks to [cryptomuseum.com](http://cryptomuseum.com/index.htm) for their excellent documentation of the [Enigma M4](http://cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/m4/) and other Enigma variants, especially for providing the wiring of its many rotors and reflectors.

Disclaimer: this project is just for funsies and the Enigma is not a secure means of encryption. The Germans lost the war for a variety of reasons, including that the Allies were "reading their mail" almost the entire time. So please don't use this library to encrypt anything important.
